# RWD Portfolio

## Overview

For today's lab assignment, you will work independently to create a personal portfolio. You will begin with the provided starter code and modify the contents to complete your feature tasks. Take time to review the provided code base and understand its structure before adding features.

## Resources

- [HTML5 UP templates](https://html5up.net/)

## Repository Set-up

- Create a new repository on GitHub named `portfolio`. Clone it to your local file system.
- From the command line, copy the contents of the `starter-code` folder from the course repository into the root of your `portfolio` repository. Play around with the `cp` command until you get it exactly right. Don't worry if you don't get it right the first time, just clear out the attempt, and try again.
- Add and commit this initial state of the code base to your master branch.
- From this point on, work on semantically-named non-master branches. Remember to add, commit, and push regularly.
